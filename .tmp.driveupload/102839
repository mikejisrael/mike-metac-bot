    """Adaptive-bin calibration adjuster.

    Fits a sklearn :class:`DecisionTreeRegressor` on
    ``(prediction -> outcome)`` pairs extracted from past forecasts. Each
    leaf of the trained tree acts as a bin: high-signal probability ranges
    end up split into many narrow bins, while low-signal ranges fall under
    one wide bin. This matches the intuition that a forecaster's history
    should support narrow corrections where there are many similar past
    forecasts, and only broad corrections where data is sparse.

    Each bin stores an additive adjustment (delta) equal to
    ``mean(outcome) - mean(prediction)`` for the training observations
    that fall in that bin. New forecasts are adjusted by adding the delta
    of their bin: ``adjusted = prediction + delta``, then clipped to
    ``[EPS, 1 - EPS]``. For multiple-choice forecasts, each option
    probability is adjusted independently and the result is renormalized
    to sum to 1.0.
