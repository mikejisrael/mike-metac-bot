            # AI Forecasting Congress V2: Scenario-Focused Synthesis Report

            You are synthesizing the proposals from multiple AI congress members
            deliberating on the following policy question:

            "{prompt}"

            # Scenarios Identified Across Members

            {scenarios_text}

            # Individual Proposals

            {proposals_text}

            ---

            # Your Task

            Write a comprehensive synthesis report that integrates scenario
            planning with policy analysis. Structure as follows:

            ### Executive Summary

            A 3-4 sentence overview of:
            - The key scenarios identified and their implications
            - The areas of agreement and disagreement across members
            - The most important forecasts that inform the debate

            ### Scenario Consensus

            Synthesize the scenarios across members:
            - Where do members agree on likely scenarios?
            - What key drivers do multiple members identify?
            - Are there scenarios some members missed that others caught?
            - What is the "consensus scenario map" — the 2-4 scenarios that
              best capture the range of plausible futures?

            ### Consensus Recommendations

            What policies do multiple members support? For each:
            - State the recommendation
            - List which members support it
            - Include relevant forecasts with footnotes [^N]
            - Note which scenarios this recommendation is best suited for

            ### Key Disagreements

            Where do members diverge and why? For each:
            - State the issue
            - Summarize each side's position
            - Explain how different scenarios, forecasts, or values lead to
              different conclusions
            - Assess the crux of the disagreement

            ### Cross-Scenario Robustness Matrix

            Create a summary matrix showing how different proposals perform
            across the consensus scenarios:
            - Which proposals are robust (work well across all scenarios)?
            - Which proposals are fragile (only work in specific scenarios)?
            - What are the key decision drivers — which external factors does
              the decision depend on most?

            ### Baseline Forecast Comparison

            Compare BASELINE forecasts across members:
            - Where forecasts converged (similar probabilities)
            - Where forecasts diverged significantly
            - What explains the differences

            ### Scenario-Conditional Forecast Comparison

            Compare SCENARIO-CONDITIONAL forecasts across members:
            - How do members' scenario probabilities differ?
            - Under each scenario, where do outcome predictions align or diverge?
            - Which scenarios show the most forecast uncertainty?

            ### Proposal-Conditional Forecast Comparison

            Compare PROPOSAL-CONDITIONAL forecasts:
            - Which proposals show the largest expected improvement over status quo?
            - Which proposals have the most uncertain outcomes?
            - Where do members predict unintended consequences?

            ### Integrated Recommendations

            Your synthesis of the best policy path forward:
            - Robust actions that work across all scenarios (no-regret moves)
            - Scenario-contingent actions with clear trigger conditions
            - Key hedging strategies
            - Early warning indicators to monitor
            - Be specific and actionable

            ### Combined Forecast Appendices

            Compile all forecasts by type (baseline, scenario indicator,
            scenario-conditional, proposal-conditional) from all members.
            Group similar forecasts and note the range of predictions.

            Format each forecast as:

            [^1] **[Question Title]** (from [Member Name])
            - Question: [Full question]
            - Resolution: [Resolution criteria]
            - Prediction: [Probability]
            - Reasoning: [Summary]

            Number the footnotes sequentially across all appendices.

            ---

            Be balanced but not wishy-washy. Identify which arguments are
            strongest and why. Your goal is to help decision-makers understand
            which policies are robust across scenarios and which are risky bets.

            # Scenario Report: Formal Scenario Planning Document

            You are writing a formal scenario planning report in the style of
            Shell's scenario planning documents or the National Intelligence
            Council's Global Trends reports. This should be a polished,
            professional document suitable for senior decision-makers.

            ## Policy Question

            "{prompt}"

            ## Aggregated Analysis

            ```markdown

            ## Your Task

            Write a formal Scenario Report with the following structure:

            # Scenario Report: [Descriptive Title]

            ## Executive Summary

            A 1-page executive summary of the strategic question, the scenario
            framework, and the key implications for decision-makers.
            (4-6 paragraphs)

            ## The Strategic Landscape

            Context-setting section describing the current situation, key
            trends, and why scenario planning is valuable for this question.
            (3-4 paragraphs)

            ## The Scenario Framework

            ### Key Drivers of Uncertainty

            Describe the 2-3 most important drivers that shape the future.
            Explain why these were selected and what makes them uncertain.

            ### The Scenario Matrix

            Present the scenario framework. If 2 drivers dominate, describe
            the 2x2 matrix. Otherwise, explain the logic behind the
            scenario set.

            ## Scenario Narratives

            For EACH scenario (2-4), write a 1-2 page narrative:

            ### [Scenario Name]

            **Probability:** [X%]

            **The Story:** A vivid, engaging narrative describing how this
            scenario unfolds. Written as if telling the story of the next
            5-10 years. Include specific developments, turning points,
            and cause-and-effect chains.

            **Key Indicators:** Early warning signs that this scenario is
            materializing (drawn from the scenario criteria).

            **Implications for Policy:** What this scenario means for the
            policy question. Which approaches work and which fail.

            ## Strategic Implications

            ### Robust Strategies

            Actions that perform well across ALL scenarios. These are the
            "no-regret" moves decision-makers should pursue regardless of
            which scenario unfolds.

            ### Contingent Strategies

            Actions that should be triggered only if specific scenarios
            begin to materialize. Include clear trigger conditions.

            ### Hedging Strategies

            Actions designed to reduce downside risk in adverse scenarios,
            even if they have some cost in favorable scenarios.

            ## Early Warning System

            A monitoring framework:
            - For each scenario, list the key indicators to watch
            - For each indicator, specify what data to track
            - Define trigger thresholds for activating contingent strategies

            ## Conclusion

            Closing thoughts on the strategic outlook and the most important
            actions decision-makers should take now.

            ---

            ## Guidelines

            - Write for senior decision-makers who need actionable insight
            - Be vivid and concrete in scenario narratives
            - Use specific forecasts and probabilities from the analysis
            - The tone should be professional but engaging, not academic
            - Scenario narratives should feel like plausible stories, not
              dry descriptions
            - Total length: 3000-5000 words
            - Use markdown formatting with clear headers

            ## Your Task

            Write 2-3 compelling scenario-specific newspaper narratives.

            ### Approach

            1. First, use the roll_multiple_dice tool to determine which scenario
               materializes. Roll dice for each scenario indicator forecast.

            2. Pick the 2 most contrasting scenarios to write about.

            3. For each selected scenario, write a newspaper narrative:

            #### NARRATIVE: "[Scenario Name]" — Recommendations Implemented

            Start with: "The date is <date you pick>..."

            Write a flowing narrative assuming:
            - The AI Congress's recommendations were implemented
            - This specific scenario materialized
            - For each relevant forecast, ROLL THE DICE using the
              roll_multiple_dice tool to determine outcomes
            - Use CONDITIONAL forecasts for policy-dependent outcomes
            - Use BASELINE forecasts for background events
            - For gaps, create plausible estimates marked with *

            Reference forecasts inline: "(X% [^N])"

            #### NARRATIVE: "[Scenario Name]" — Recommendations Rejected

            A contrasting narrative showing what the world looks like if
            recommendations were NOT implemented under this scenario.
            Use BASELINE forecasts for all outcomes.

            ---

            ## Guidelines

            - Make narratives vivid and engaging, like real journalism
            - Include specific dates, names (real where relevant, fake
              marked with †), and concrete details
            - Show cause-and-effect relationships
            - Your own estimates marked with * should be plausible
            - Neutral/journalistic tone
            - Include both positive and negative consequences
            - Each forecast should be explicitly mentioned with dice outcome
            - Ground speculation in research where possible
            - 1500-2500 words total across all narratives

            Include footnotes at the end of each narrative with full
            forecast details and outcomes.
